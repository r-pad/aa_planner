# FFAST Planner

This module integrates trained models into the FFAST software architecture to run obstacle avoidance algorithms on the FFAST RC vehicle.

## Notes

While Python 3 is not supported in ROS Kinetic, Python 3 is needed to run the network. As a result, it is imperative that the user uses a virtual environment and installs necessary Python 3 packages within the virtual environment to support this, using pip and not apt-get.
